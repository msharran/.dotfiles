# config.nvim

A place for my neovim configs. I have a mix of vimscript and lua.
I prefer
  - `vimscript` for setting maps, abbrevs, autocommands and options
  - `lua` for custom functional configurations (mostly for plugins)

I prefer `vim-plug` as it is minimal and simple. Moreover, I try
to stick to vim specific directories like `plugin`, `ftplugin` for
organizing my config.
